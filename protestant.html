                <h4>Section 1--What is it? What's its impact?</h4>
                <p>
                    "Peace if possible; truth at all costs." this is a quote from Martin Luther, a famous German theologian and religious reformer in the Protestant Reformation. (CTX Blog, 2021) (Hillerbrand, 2024) 
                    The Protestant Reformation was a religious reform movement that swept through Europe in the 1500s. 
                    To be specific, this is a movement first began in Germany at the year 1517, when Martin Luther, a teacher and a monk, published a document called “Disputation on the Power of Indulgences”, or “95 Theses” to oppose the Church selling the indulgence. (National Geographic, n.d) 
                    The appear of the Protestant Reformation is very crucial even especially during the Renaissance and change the history for two reasons. 
                    Firstly, the appear of Protestant Reformation challenged the authority of the Catholic Church by bringing an end to the ecclesiastical unity of medieval Christianity. (Harvey, 2023) 
                    On top of that, the Protestant Reformation also lead to millions of Europeans to leave the Catholicism to join the new Protestant acts. (Petrarca, 2023)  
                    In addition, the Protestant Reformation not only effect the world before, but also effect the world today. 
                    The Protestant Reformation has influenced the Morden world in many positive ways. For example, there are cultural achievements in areas such as art, technology, philosophy and many more. 
                    Also, many famous artists, philosophers and inventors from that time appear and have made a huge impact on society today by bringing great works. (Bartleby research, n.d)

                <h4>Section 2--Research Question： What are the main factors that influenced the start of the Protestant Reformation against the Church?</p></h4>
                <p>
                    I think this question is crucial and relevant because of two reasons. 
                    Firstly, if we look closely with the situation, we could learn and understand more about the situation that have happened and about the idea of famous people. 
                    Secondly, is because we could discover about why Martin Luther starts the Protestant Reformation, and what methods he used to successfully find followers deal with this problem.

                <h4>Section 3--Possible Answers</h4>
                <h4><p>So what are the main factors that influenced the start of the Protestant Reformation against the Church?</p></h4>
                <p>
                    The start of Protestant Reformation is caused by a variety different reasons, and two of the most important ones include the protest of “95 theses” wrote by Martin Luther, and the dissatisfied Henry VIII toward the Church. 
                    One of the main reasons is because Martin Luther, the leader of the reformation, didn’t believe and understand about the part when the Church is selling indulgence. 
                    To be specific, indulgence is business Church in the Renaissance do, and this business is done by giving money toward the Church so all your sins will disappear, resulting you to be able to go to heaven. 
                    Martin Luther argued against the Church about the indulgence that could be buy in order to earn forgiveness from God is wrong. 
                    However, he believes that salvation should be a gift that God gives only to those who are faith to God. (National Geographic. n.d) 
                    Due to the protest and “95 theses”, the Catholic Church finally stopped selling indulgences in the year 1567. (Duggan. 2024) 
                    On top of that, the second reason about how the reformation began is by Henry VIII. 
                    In the year 1534, Henry asked the Pope Clement VII for an annulment of his marriage to Catherine. 
                    In detail, to annul a marriage means to delete it forever and to declare that it never existed. 
                    Initially, in 1529, the Pope had allowed Henry to annul the marriage, however in the end, the Pope refused to give Henry his marriage annulment. (Imagining History. 2023) 
                    And this event result Henry to be angry, and resulting him challenging the authority of Pope by rejecting the direction. 
                    So, instead of following the Church, he decided creates another Church in England with a mix of different religions and become its leader. (National Geographic. n.d) 
                    To conclude, there are two factors that cause the Protestant Reformation happen, which is the “95 theses” wrote by Martin Luther, and the Henry VIII who is dissatisfied by the pope.

                            This piece of writing is written by Martin Luther on October 31, 1517, at the door of the Castle Church in Wittenberg, Germany. 
                            This piece of writing is called “95 theses” that was created to tell all the disadvantages of the Church. 
                            In addition, this piece of writing contributed to the Protestant Reformation by acting as a catalyst for the reformation since it spread over many countries. (History. 2020)
