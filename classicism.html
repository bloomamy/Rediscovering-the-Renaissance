                <p>

                    It depicted Venus, the goddess of love and beauty in Greek mythology, born from the sea. 
                    In literature, classicism inspired the litterateur to references to the ancient Greek and Roman precedents in poetry and theatre. 
                    For example, “Devine Comedy” from Dante is a tri-part play structure in Greek style. 
                    It takes idea from “Aeneid” by Virgil and other classical poetry. 
                    From the view of architecture, classicism has led to the significant transformation of style to ancient Greco-Roman and other classical style. 
                    Architecture during the Renaissance period imitated Ancient Doric and Corinthian style columns, Roman dome and tunnel vault. 
                    The Santa Maria Novella cathedral in Florence well presented the transformation of style from Gothic to Greco-Roman. (Davis, 2019)
                    By refocus and praise on Ancient Greek and Roman’s art, theme, cultural value and aesthetic idea, 
                    it inspired the innovation in art, literature, and architecture and played an important role in art, literature and architecture. 
                    Classicism has had a lasting impact on the world since the Renaissance era.

                <h4><p>Section 3--Possible Answers</p></h4>
                <p>
                    The revival of classical mythology has had a profound impact on the Renaissance artworks 
                    by providing a rich source of inspiration and material for the artists. 
                    Artists during renaissance period has fascinated by the charm and depth of classical legends, 
                    they started using famous stories, gods and heroes from classical mythology as the themes in their artwork. 
                    The artworks and sculptures start to get into the spirit of the classical stories. 
                    It brings the audience to various of myth of heroes and epic legends. (Dataentry, 2023)
                    Without classical mythology, the background of the painting will be less rich and not very able to express the feelings the author wants to express. 
                    Take Sandro Botticelli’s “The Birth of Venus” as an example, without classical mythology, the painting would be a picture of a woman born from sea level. 
                    However, as classical mythology has been added, this painting will be telling the birth of the Roman goddess Venus from the sea and the birth of beauty and love. (Cooch, 2024) 
                    The stories from classical mythology brings depth and provides materials and nutrients for artworks. 
                    Classical mythology gives people rich inspiration. 
                    Artists start using its backgrounds, characters and stories. 
                    Sometimes artists will express their ethical values though the artworks by using the backgrounds, characters and stories from classical mythology. 
                    Famous artists such as Raphael and Titian also reinterpreted the myths, adapted and reimagined classical stories.
                    For example, Titian’s Diana and Actaeon recomposed Greek mythology and incorporated symbol of Christian themes. 
                    According to the Ovid’s “Metamorphoses”， Actaeon accidentally discovered the secret bathing place of Diana, the goddess of moon and hunt while he was hunting. 
                    The skull of the male deer on the top right corner hints the fate of Actaeon. 
                    Outraged Diana turned him into a deer and been devoured by his hunting dog. 
                    Titian recomposed the myth by adding Christian themes of shame and guilt and conveyed it in the expression of the characters. (National Galleries of Scotland, n.d.)
                    Another example, “The Triumph of Galatea”. 
                    The author Raphael celebrates love and beauty by depicting the Galatea, 
                    the sea nymph, with other character surrounded her and been carried by two dolphins. (Down, 2023)
                    Not only painting but also sculptures. 
                    Perseus and the Head of Medusa by Benvenuto Cellini also borrowed elements from ancient Greek mythology. 
                    Perseus was the son of Zeus and Danaë in Greek mythology. (THEOI, n.d.) 
                    Cellini depicts Perseus bronze statues, standing with the head of Medusa in his hand in the bronze statue. (Harris and Drogin, 2015)
                    The trait of dramatic in classical mythology also provides a chance for artists to create a multi-character composition artwork. 
                    For example, in “The Feast of the gods” by Giovanni Bellini and Titian, Silenus, Bacchus, Mercury, Jupiter, 
                    Maia, Apollo and other many others appears in this multi-character composition painting. (Nalezyty, n.d.)
                    In conclusion, classical mythology played an important role in the creation of Renaissance art. 
                    It provides artists with rich inspiration and materials, allows them to created artworks with depth and medium to express emotions and moral values. 
                    Through reinterpreted, reimagine and incorporate elements from different aspects, artists gave new force for classical mythology and renaissance artworks. 
                    Therefore, classical mythology has had a significant and lasting impact on Renaissance art and became an important part of artistic creation.
