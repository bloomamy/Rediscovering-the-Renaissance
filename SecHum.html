                <h4>Section 1--What is it? What's its impact?</h4>
                <p>
                    Secularism and humanism have both great impact on the renaissance and also the modern world.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Secularism means not been influenced by religion, being equal and balanced (humanists, n.d). 
                    Humanism is an example of secularism, which means not being influenced by anything and doing things for the benefit of people (understanding humanism, n.d). 
                    In Europe, the time of renaissance, people also follow these ideas. 
                    For instance, humanism tells us we should have our own views and realize the value of us, this let many famous artists emerged (Britannica, n.d). 
                    Examples include, under this influence, artists of the renaissance no longer saw nude bodies and other real images of people as something to be ashamed of, they creative some of the greatest works of art such as a portrait of the goddess Venus and a sculpture of David. 
                    It also had an impact on the fields of science and mathematics, as the astronomer Nicolas Copernicus wrote “On the Revolutions of the Heavenly Sphere”put forward his ideas, the connection between this and humanism is confidence and keep discovering things (Cartwright.M, 2020). 
                    For the impact of nowadays, in current studies and in other life situations, we are encouraged to think and come to our own point of view, also thinking critically.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This is how secularism and humanism impact the modern world and during the renaissance.

                <h4>Section 3--Possible Answers</h4>
                <p>
                    Secularism and humanism during the renaissance had impacted on many things, paintings is an example. 
                    In the renaissance, people's secularism was humanism, see people and other things as they are. 
                    Art works are no longer religious like before, but had their own characteristics. 
                    Three examples were the paintings of Jesus and the Virgin Mary also the painting “Primavera” which painted the gods in the myths. 
                    In this article, the divine ratio by Leonardo da Vinci will also be mentioned.
                </p>
                <p>
                    There is a renaissance man who is good at many fields(dictionary, n.d), Leonardo Davinci discovered the divine ratio, this often appears at art, architecture and other areas. 
                    This ratio was been calculated, which roughly equals to 1.618, and in his opinion, he thinks that this is a universal ratio, and things in the world can show the most beautiful side as long as they follow this divine ratio(The art History, n.d). 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Also At the same time, during this period, painters paid more attention to painting clear details of the figures and body as well as emotions and expressions. 
                    For example before the renaissance during the medieval ages in the painting called “Madonna Enthroned with Angels and Prophets” by Cimabue, the painting depicts the newborn Jesus in the arms of the Virgin Mary, but his face does not look like a normal child, but like a man's face. 
                    But later in the renaissance, Leonardo da Vinci created the painting “Virgin of the Rocks”, also a painting of Virgin Mary and Jesus, but in this painting created during the renaissance, the face is much more detailed and look like the face of a real baby compared with the medieval painting of the newborn Jesus (Mann.Z, 2020). 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Another example includes “Primavera” painted in the 14s by Sandro Botticelli, in this painting, the painter describes Venus, the god of love, dancing with some other gods. 
                    However, in this painting, many female figures are almost nude, which also accords with humanism in art during the renaissance, and this was also reflected in other types of artistic works (The art History, n.d).
                </p>
                <p>
                    In conclusion, compared to the Middle Ages, the secularism of the renaissance have changed a lot, this reflected on artists’ paintings, making the details of the painting more exquisite, and more lifelike, fitting to the secularism during the renaissance.

                            This painting was drawn at about 1485(visituffizi, n.d) by an Italian painter(Britannica, 2024),Sandro Botticelli.
                            This painting is relevant to my subject because it is a portrait of secularism at that time. 
                            In this painting, the painter describes the nude image of the goddess Venus with the symbol of humanism, which express their awe of human bodies and the true image of human.

                            The painting was painted in 1482 by the famous architect and painter, Leonardo da Vinci, it is called “The Virgin of the rocks”. 
                            It describes the Virgin Mary and some little children in a beautiful background. 
                            This painting is related to secularism and humanism because as mentioned above, this painting is a renaissance painting about baby Jesus. 
                            Compared with medieval paintings, it is like a normal baby face, not like the face of an man, connected with humanism, see something they really are. 
                            At the same time, we can also see that the painting is very exquisite on the face of the Virgin Mary, which what art changed during the renaissance.(Mann.Z,2020).
