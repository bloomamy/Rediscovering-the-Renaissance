                <h4>Section 1--What is it? What's its impact?</h4>
                <p>Individualism, is the “importance of personality, and uniqueness of an individual”, which basically is to show that they are different from one another and separate themselves from the crowd. (IPL.org, n.d)
                    The Renaissance Men such as Leonardo Da Vinci and Michelangelo Buonarroti, who are “knowledgeable or proficient in a variety of fields”, are all emphasizing their uniqueness in their own way, through paintings, sculptures, or even inventions. (Gunner, 2021) 
                    This is important during the Renaissance era, because the emerge of the idea of individualism encouraged the people during the Renaissance to explore deeper into different fields, expressing themselves. 
                    This had contributed to the enrichment of the variety of ideas, the emerge of techniques and skills, and the combination of knowledge from different fields. 
                    Even after the Renaissance, the idea of “individualism” as affected the world now a lot too. It had inspired people to express different views, create unique works, and not be afraid of not fitting the crowd. 
                    This is especially emphasized in education of countries such as the United States, Britain, and lots more. 
                    This bloom of perspectives, development, and the understanding of the world had led people to discover their interests in various fields, also contributing to the growth of “Renaissance Men”, where people combine what they knew in different fields into something that is outstanding, creative, and maybe even revolutionary.

                    and its spread across the world during the Renaissance?

                <p>
                    This question asked for the root cause and the impact of the bloom of individualism during the renaissance, 
                    which is crucial for actually understanding individualism during the Renaissance.

                <h4>Section 3--Possible Answers</h4>
                <p>The Renaissance, is a cultural movement that occurred all around the world during the 14th to 17th century. 
                    Before the Renaissance, it was the Middle Ages, where people were mostly fighting, and most of them were poor. 
                    But after the Black Death, which killed “more than 25 million people in fourteenth-century Europe”, 
                    wealth quickly goes into the hand of the remaining population, and people starts to have the time and efforts to consider other things besides living. 
                    (History of the Plague: An Ancient Pandemic for the Age of COVID-19, 2020) 
                    With this “rise of a wealthy and powerful class”, people start to have “an increased emphasis on individual achievement and personal success”. (How did the concept of individualism emerge during the Renaissance, n.d) 
                    And this trend spreads across the world, leading to the revival of the idea of individualism. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Another factor that contributed to the spread of the idea of individualism is the Protestant Reformation. 
                    First, the revival of individualism had “laid the foundation of Reformation in which people protested the corruption of the Church.” (IPL, n.d) 
                    Then, the Protestant Reformation had discouraged people to “follow the absolute rule of the Church”, promoting the idea of individualism even more. (IPL, n.d) 
                    Where people are having their own thoughts, and not just follow the Church. 
                    So the revival of individualism and the Protestant Reformation helps the spread of each other, creating a beneficial cycle.

                        <h4><p>School of Athens--Raffaello Sanzio da Urbino (Raphael)</p></h4>
                        <p>
                            This artwork was painted in the year 1511. 
                            In there, Raphael had managed to paint the “finest period of Greek Philosophy”, because we can find “Aristotle and Plato in the center”. (Natizens, 2019) 
                            Out of all the Greek Philosopher, we can clearly define each person from another. 
                            And this is because Raphael had perfectly shown the characteristics of every figure, showcasing individualism.

                        <p>
                            This painting painted in the year 1512 has depicted “Mother Mary holding baby Jesus in her hands with Saint Barbara and Saint Sixtus on both her sides”, there’re also two little angles below. (Natizens, 2019) 
                            In this painting, Raphael had also drawn the characteristics of each character, and each figure in the painting is unique. 
                            Even the two little angles at the bottom are different from each other. 
                            Also showing individualism.
